        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: What currency do I need to bring with me?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> The majority of connections will be through the US and therefore we recommend having US dollars. Please bear in mind that many of the major US airlines no longer accept cash for onboard purchases. The Euro is the main currency in Spain. Traditionally, the best rate of exchange can be found using a Currency Exchange office, which are available in the arrivals terminal at the airport and around the city.  Be sure to notify your bank that you will be in Europe and take note of your 4 digit pin/password. At this time, you can also confirm what fees your bank charges for exchanging money and foreign purchases.<p></p>

        <h3 id="hotel">Hotel</h3>

        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Will I need to bring toiletries and other personal items?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> You will find a range of complimentary amenities in your room at the Hotel Arts, including two bottles of water, refreshed daily, hairdryer, thick terry bathrobes, slippers, Asprey toiletries including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, and bath salts.

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Will my hair dryer, flat iron, razor or other electronics work in Barcelona?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> In Spain, electric power comes through at 220 volts and at 50 Hertz. Though similar to most of Europe, this differs from the 110-120 volts at 60 Hz North American/Caribbean electrical standard.<p></p>

        <p>Your laptop, tablet and/or phone will most likely only require a plug adapter as these types of electronics normally accept 110-220V and therefore no voltage converter would be required. Other appliances such as hair dryers, curlers and razors that are not dual voltage will require both a plug adapter and voltage converter. A limited number of plug adaptors are available at the Hotel Arts.</p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Is there a safe available?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> Yes. Wi-Fi and wired connections are available in-room and Wi-FI available in public areas free of charge to Sagicor Convention guests.<p></p>

        <strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately not - all Company sponsored functions and events are for Convention participants and their traveling companion only.<p></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <h3 id="electricity">Electricity/Voltage</h3>

        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: What is the voltage in Barcelona, Spain?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> Electricity in Barcelona is 220/240 volts; 50 Hz. Any electrical equipment you carry with you that operates at the lower (100/127V) rate will need to be dual-voltage or used with a converter.<p></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: What type of plug is used in Barcelona?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> In Spain, as well as in most of Europe (except the UK &amp; Ireland) you will find Plug F commonly referred to as the "Schuko plug". This socket is also compatible with plug types C, E &amp; F.<p></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Will my hair dryer/curling iron work in Barcelona?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> Flat and curling irons are the bane of modern-day travel. These devices cannot often be used in dual voltage situations without voltage conversion. They are extremely high current devices, meaning that combined with the high voltage, they use a whole lot of power. You'll need to carry either dual voltage curling or flat irons or a large power converter or transformer to convert Spainï¿½s higher voltage to the lower American voltage. If you buy a converter, make sure its power rating meets or exceeds the power rating of the single device you will use with it. This information is usually found on the body of the device near the power cord. Hair dryers are provided in each room.<p></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Will my "other" electrical appliances work in Barcelona?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> Most laptops, most recently produced battery chargers, and many small, electrical gadgets, especially those designed for world travel will only require a plug adapter if they are designed to run on dual voltages. You can check the back of the device or the "power brick" for the electrical input specifications. The device only needs a plug adapter to work in Spain if it can use any voltage between 100 and 240 and its AC voltage alternates at 50 or 60 hertz<p></p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>



        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: What currency is accepted in Barcelona, Spain?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> Spain's currency is the Euro (EUR), and the exchange rate is approximately â¬0.90 = $1.00.  To find the most up to date exchange rate go to www.XE.com Currency Converter.<p></p>

        <p>Spanish auto banks will enable anyone with a Visa-based card to withdraw cash from their home account.</p>

        <p>The majority of tourist services, stores, hotels and restaurants take most major credit cards such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express as well as Debit Cards and Traveler's Cheques. If you have a credit card, you will find that it provides one of the best exchange rates. Although you will not receive Euros directly, your monthly balance usually shows the exchange rate you received on purchases made with the credit card.</p>

        <p><a id="toplink" rel="" href="#top">TOP</a></p>



        <h3 id="taxes">Taxes &amp; refunds</h3>



        <p>In Barcelona the majority of the shops have signed up with the Tax Free Shopping Service (approximately 90%) making it easy to claim back the VAT tax you pay on items purchased in Spain. While most stores will display their TAX FREE sticker, some may not so it is always best to ask before you pay! This amounts to a saving of 21% off the price of any items purchased while in Spain where the total bill exceeds â¬90.15. The tax saving however is not applicable to restaurant, hotel bills, or any other items that are considered consumables.</p>

        <p>Once you have confirmed that the store you are purchasing from participates in the tax free service you can request the TAX refund 'cheques' which the shop will fill out for you. They will then present you with a cheque for your tax refund which you take with you to the airport. You collect these cheques from every shop that you visit when you purchase goods.</p>

        <p>When you arrive at the airport you must present you tax refund cheques at customs BEFORE you check your bags in. Customs may request to check the items before they stamp your cheques. Once your cheques have been stamped by customs you will receive your refund from the Global Blue Office (the Tax-Free agent in Barcelona, Spain). Please note that you only have three months from the date of purchase to get your tax free forms stamped when you leave the European Union zone.

        <strong>A:</strong> Tap water in Barcelona is drinkable and safe. Some people don't like the taste very much, but it is completely safe for drinking and cooking and won't upset your stomach.<p></p>

        <p>It is also safe to drink the water from the public drinking fountains which are in many places around Barcelona. If you drink from the public drinking water fountain near the top of Las Ramblas street in Barcelona called La Font de Canaletes, then legend has it that you will always return to Barcelona!!</p>

        <p></p><h5><strong>Q: Should I tip?</strong></h5>

        <strong>A:</strong> The standard gratuities for your accommodation and/or activities during the Convention have been taken care of by Sagicor for you. For any personal expenditures outside of the Convention, however, tipping in Spain is considered entirely optional and is not very common. You may see people leaving small change at cafes and bars possibly tipping up to 10% at a nice expensive restaurant if the service isn't already included (servicio incluido). Tipping in a taxi is also very rare and rounding up to the nearest Euro is more than sufficient.<p></p>
