                        They say that football is a religion. Well, that is certainly the case  in Barcelona! It forms the backbone of their popular culture, bringing people together  and also creating rifts between the supporters of different teams.
                        Whichever team you support however, everyone knows that Barcelona is the  best team in the world!
                        Don’t miss the opportunity to visit Camp Nou, one of the veritable  cathedrals of world football. The full tour takes some 90 minutes, including a  visit to the away team’s changing area, the chapel, the edge of the pitch, the  stalls and boxes as well as the press and trophy rooms. There is also time at the  end for a bit of shopping at the boutique</p></td>

                        This fun activity will be led by an English speaking sommelier who will  give the guests a short introduction to Spanish wines and their varying qualities  depending on their regions. This introduction will not last more than 20  minutes as we prefer to keep the activity to be participative and fun.
                        Afterwards, a blind tasting of Spanish wines takes place.
                        The guests then have to locate the different wines on a map of the Spain  and also place them in the right price order, from less to more expensive.
                        The group also tastes some typical Spanish dishes from different regions  of the country. Their job is to locate where the dishes come from and situate  each dish on the map, together with the corresponding wine.
                        This activity takes place in La Tinaja, an enormously charming restaurant in  Barcelona’s old town, just next to Santa Maria del Mar church. </p></td>

                        If you are looking for a way to delve into Spanish culture and  gastronomy… We have exactly what you are looking for!              In this class you will be learning the  secrets of Spanish cuisine from a local chef who will not only assist you but  also teach you the secrets to a great gazpacho or the perfect paella.
                        Your lesson will start as most cooking  sessions should, with a stroll to the market, where you will walk around  learning about the fruits and vegetables in season, the hidden gems of Spanish  gastronomy and the secrets to choosing the freshest fish.
                        Once back in the kitchen, aprons on, groceries bought and a glass of  wine in your hand, your chef will introduce each dish and explain each step.  Before you know it you’ll be elbow deep in the experience, cutting, toasting,  frying and rubbing, the aromas will start to wake up your appetite and  transport you to the heart of the Mediterranean…bringing you closer to the  Spanish way of life that inevitably always involves gathering around food and  wine.
                        As soon as everything is done you will sit around the table as a  Spanish family would, enjoying the taste of Spain, the heavenly combination of  vegetables of the Andalusian gazpacho, the strong flavors of a toasted paella  and the simple pleasure of the texture of our “crema catalana”. A trip down the  east coast of Spain that you will remember and treasure as part of your Spanish  experience! </p></td>

                        The tour  takes the guests to the picturesque village of Sitges, some 40 minutes south of  Barcelona.
                        Upon  arrival in Sitges our guests will enjoy a guided tour of the charming streets  of the town with their fantastic examples of art nouveau buildings and local  boutiques. They will then head up to the church built right on the edge of the  sea as they learn some of the fascinating local history.            Not many  people know this but Sitges is the home of the Bacardi family, so during the  tour our guests will enjoy a cocktail masterclass before heading to lunch by  the sea. </p></td>
