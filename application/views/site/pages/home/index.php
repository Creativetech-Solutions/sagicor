        <p>What  city in the world could be more perfect with a cosmopolitan flair, a joie de  vivre, breath-taking architecture, fantastic gastronomy and an unbeatable  climate? And with that we say, <em>Benvinguts  a Barcelona</em>! The capital of Catalonia is a feast for the senses, with its  beguiling mix of ancient and modern architecture, tempting cafés and markets,  and sun-drenched Mediterranean beaches. A stroll along La Rambla and through  waterfront Barceloneta, as well as a tour of Gaudí's majestic La Sagrada  Família Basilica and his other unique creations, are part of a visit to Spain's  second-largest city. Modern art museums and chic shops call for attention, too.  Barcelona's vibe stays lively well into the night, when you can linger over  regional wine and cuisine at buzzing tapas bars.</p>
