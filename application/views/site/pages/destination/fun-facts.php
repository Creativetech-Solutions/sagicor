                <h3>The City's founding origins are still in dispute</h3>

                There are two Spanish legends concerning the establishment of Barcelona. One legend says that it was founded by Hercules, 400 years before the building of Rome.  But, according to the other legend, the city was founded in the 3rd century BC by the Carthaginian Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal.  He named the city Barcino after his family, the Barca family of Carthage.</li>

                <h3>Barcelona is considered the "Best Beach City" in the world by National Geographic, but their beaches weren't used for leisure until 1992</h3>

                Today there are seven beaches with a total of 4.5 km of coastline, but before 1992, Barcelona's seaside was completely over run by industries. It wasn't until the city's redevelopment for the 1992 Olympic Games that the city moved their industries and converted the seaside area into an exemplary leisure area for locals and tourist alike; including the enhancement of two beaches and the creation of five new beaches. According to Discovery Channel, Barceloneta beach is the best urban beach in the world and the third best beach in the world.</li>

                <h3>La Rambla is not just one street... it's five streets</h3>

                La Rambla is probably the most famous street in Barcelona, but in reality it consists of 5 boulevards -or ramblas- joined to make one long promenade. It starts from Placa Catalunya and end at the Columbus statue by the waterfront.  For this reason, this 2-kilometer long boulevard is also commonly known in plural as Las Ramblas. Thousands of people stroll on Las Ramblas every day and night, where they watch the performing street artists, shop, or sit for a coffee or glass of Cava. Las Ramblas is the major centre of activities in the city and is undoubtedly the most famous promenade of Barcelona, and probably in all of Spain.</li>

                <h3>The hallmark grid pattern of the city came from a revolutionary utopian master plan</h3>

                Most of the city of Barcelona was designed by Ildefons Cerda i Sunyer for the 19th-century extension of the city.  The plan, called Eixample, was intended to create the perfect environment for Barcelona's fast expanding population.  He considered traffic and transport along with sunlight and ventilation for the design of his characteristic octagonal blocks, where the streets broaden at every intersection making for greater visibility, better ventilation, and more significant open spaces.  In the end, however, the plan wasn't built following all the utopian characteristics he envisioned in his plan.</li>

                <h3>Gaudi was not the original architect of Sagrada Familia</h3>

                Even though La Sagrada Familia is one of the major works of Antoni Gaudi, he was not the first architect to be appointed to work on it.  Architect Francisco de Paula del Villar was the first to be commissioned to design the church. Construction of the crypt of the church began on March 19, 1882, following Villar's design.  It wasn't until 1883 when Antoni Gaudi started working on the project.  On March 18, 1883, Villar retired from the project, and Gaudi assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed dramatically.</li>

                <h3>La Sagrada Familia has taken longer to build than the Great Pyramids</h3>

                The great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt only took 20 years to build with ancient tools, and so far, La Sagrada Familia has taken around 200 hundred years to be constructed even with the help of modern technology. The main feature of this building is its height, which equals 984 meters. However, Gaudi believed that the highest point in the city should be a natural god made structure, with this he was referring to the mountain of Montjuic, which is 984 feet above sea level.</li>

                <h3>Barcelona boasts a total of 9 UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h3>

                Seven of those sites were created by Gaudi including Park Guell, Palau Guell, Casa Mila, Casa Vicens, La Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo and the Crypt of the Church at Colonia Guell. The other two sites, Palau de la Musica Catalana (one of the world's leading concert halls) and Hospital de Sant Pau were designed by architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner.</li>

                <h3>The real story behind the Columbus monument</h3>

                The Columbus Monument was built in 1888 for the World Exposition. After reconstruction works, the monument was reopened in June 2013. It unites two of the most important roads of Barcelona: the traditional Ramblas and Passeig de Colon. There are many interpretations about the location Columbus is pointing. A commonly mistaken idea is that he is pointing towards America, but America is in the opposite direction. Some believe the creator decided to create the statue pointing his hand out to sea, illustrating his achievements. Other opinions say that he points towards India, the destination he was originally trying to reach via a new route when he bumped into America. Finally, another school of thought believes that the statue points out the route to Genoa, which many say is his hometown.</li>

                Saint George Day, known in Spanish as D'a de Sant Jordi, is a national Catalan holiday which many say is Barcelona's version of Valentine's Day.

The tradition is to exchange gifts between sweethearts, loved ones and friends where the man gives a rose to a woman as a sign of love, and the women gives a book, as a sign for eternal love in return.</li>
