        <h2>About Barcelona</h2>

        <p>Barcelona,  the cosmopolitan capital of Spain’s Catalonia region, is defined by quirky art  and architecture, imaginative food and vibrant street life. It has medieval  roots, seen in the maze-like Gothic Quarter, but a modernist personality  represented by architect Antoni Gaudí’s fantastical La Sagrada Família Basilica.  Its restaurant scene, anchored by the central Boqueria market, ranges from fine  dining to tiny tapas bars.</p>

        <p>The  first settlements in Barcelona date back to Neolithic times. The city itself  was founded by the Romans who set up a colony called Barcino at the end of the  1st century BC. The colony had some thousand inhabitants and was bounded by a  defensive wall, the remains of which can still be seen in the old town.</p>

        <p>For  over 200 years, Barcelona was under Muslim rule, and, following the Christian reconquest,  it became a county of the Carolingian Empire and one of the main residences of  the court of the Crown of Aragon. The fruitful medieval period established  Barcelona's position as the economic and political centre of the Western  Mediterranean. The city's Gothic Quarter bears witness to the splendour enjoyed  by the city from the 13th to the 15th centuries.</p>

        <p>From  the 15th to 18th centuries Barcelona entered a period of decline, while it  struggled to maintain its economic and political independence. This struggle  ended in 1714, when the city fell to the Bourbon troops and Catalonia's and  Catalans' rights and privileges were suppressed. A period of cultural recovery  began in the mid-19th century with the arrival of the development of the  textile industry. During this period, which was known as the Renaixença,  Catalan regained prominence as a literary language.</p>

        <p>The  20th century ushered in widespread urban renewal throughout Barcelona city,  culminating in its landmark Eixample district, which showcases some of  Barcelona's most distinctive Catalan art-nouveau, or modernista, buildings. The  Catalan Antoni Gaudí, one of the most eminent architects, designed buildings  such as the Casa Milà (known as La Pedrera, the Catalan for stone quarry), the  Casa Batlló and the Sagrada Família church, which have become world-famous  landmarks.</p>

        <p>The  freedoms achieved during this period were severely restricted during the Civil  War in 1936 and the subsequent dictatorship. With the reinstatement of  democracy in 1978, Barcelona society regained its economic strength and the  Catalan language was restored. The city's hosting of the 1992 Olympic Games  gave fresh impetus to Barcelona's potential and reaffirmed its status as a  major metropolis.</p>
