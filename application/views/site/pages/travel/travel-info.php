        <h2>Travel Information</h2>

        <p><br>

        <ol>

            <li>Situated  in the southeast of Spain on the Iberian coast, Barcelona enjoys a  Mediterranean climate, with warm summers and cooler winters but for the most  part, no extremes of temperature or weather. Although this stretch of coastline  is called Costa Brava because of its at times tempestuous weather, so the  weather in Barcelona can be less predictable than the rest of Spain.<br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>The  official Currency is the Euro, but American Dollars are accepted in most  places. The exchange rate is around €0.91 Euro to $1 US dollar. Spanish auto  banks will enable anyone with a Visa-based card to withdraw cash from their  home account. Credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard and AMEX, are widely  accepted in most of the high streets shops, restaurants and hotels. However  smaller stores and restaurants may still not have a credit card payment  facilities. While the Convention itinerary pretty much provides all your meals,  you may still want to purchase a souvenir or two so it’s good to familiarise  yourself with the exchange rate so you will recognize a bargain when you see  one. If you speak Spanish when making your bargain, even if it is a little  broken, you may find that you will get a better deal just for trying! <br>

            <li>With May signalling the end of Spring and  beginning of Summer, expect temperatures to be warm with average daytime highs  around 20 - 24°C. Evenings feel relatively fresh at the end of May, with low  between 15 - 17°C, so you'll want to bring a light jacket, shawl or something  with long sleeves.&nbsp; <br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>The  climate should be your primary consideration in deciding what clothes to pack.  Plan to pack for pleasant but warm weather, cool nights, and plenty of sunshine  during the days. <br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>Dress codes have been suggested for each of the events. Please have a  look at the program itinerary as a guideline of the activities and events in  which you will be participating. <br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>Now is a good time to check that your passport is not going to expire before December  2, 2016. You do have a passport, correct?<br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li> You may also want to review the “Travel Documents" link on this site for  your specific visa requirements (just in case!)<br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>As  always, dress comfortably for travelling.&nbsp;  Make sure you have the necessities, a change of clothes, reading  material, prescription medications etc., in your carryon bag.&nbsp; Do not pack any liquids that do not comply  with the 3-1-1 regulations, or sharp objects, penknives, scissors, (nail  clippers are okay nowadays) etc., in your carryon bag. They may be taken from  you.<br>

                <br>

            </li>

            <li>Prepare for the new age of travel security measures. Yes, they are cumbersome,  but designed to ensure your safety.&nbsp; These  measures also include random searches, both through the security check points and  sometimes before boarding the aircraft, as well as through your in-transit  airports. Relax and go with the flow. Let’s hope that the plane’s not going to  leave without you! </li>
